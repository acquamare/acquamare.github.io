- Uniqueness of the Reduced Echelon Form

Each matrix is equivalent to one and only one reduced echelon matrix.

- Existence and Uniqueness Theorem

A linear system is consistent iff rightmost column of augmented matrix is *not* a pivot column. No rows look like [0 ... 0 *b*] with b nonzero. 

If a linear system is consistent, then the solution set contains either 1 unique solution (when there are no free variables) or infinitely many solutions, when there is at least one free variable.
