# Jazz through the ages

special thanks to [musicmap](https://musicmap.info/)

### NEW ORLEANS JAZZ & DIXIELAND JAZZ

old timey, unique percussion, wartime influences, cheerful penny-arcade soundtrack

### CHICAGO JAZZ

steamboat willy music, this stuff is actually good, pretty original

### SWING / BIG BAND

what you get from the roarin' twenties and cool Disney villains (jungle book)

### THIRD STREAM / PROGRESSIVE JAZZ & MODAL JAZZ

orchestral, concert jazz; the most eclectic to me

### NEW ORLEANS & DIXIELAND JAZZ REVIVALS

rags for bands

### BEBOP

famous tunes with crazy fast and intricate solos

### COOL JAZZ & WEST COAST JAZZ

music that's found in those mid-twentieth century films

### HARD BOP

classics; songs to get hyped about

### SOUL JAZZ / JAZZ FUNK

cool cat, sunglasses are a must

### FREE JAZZ / AVANT-GARDE (JAZZ)

art "on the spot," at least it's meant to sound like that
intermittent high hat, bass, saxes, that's about it 

### FUSION / JAZZ ROCK

weird, experimental, awesome

### SMOOTH JAZZ

uplifting and romantic

### ACID JAZZ / JAZZDANCE

basically pop but more funky

### NU JAZZ / ELECTRO JAZZ

soft workout music, chill beats and repetitive treble

### NORDIC JAZZ

peaceful, soothing

### ELECTRO SWING

(lone digger)
