Linear functions, like f(x) = mx + b, are examples of deterministic functions.  Recall, a function is just mathematical mapping from one set, the domain, to another set, the codomain.  But a deterministic function is one where the same input yields the same output, but a probabilistic function is one where the same input can yield different outputs.

** Examples: **
- f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c is deterministic function.
- f(x) = 1 half the time, 0 otherwise is probabilistic function.

In this class, we focus on probabilistic distributions instead of prob. functions. Most commonly, Normal (Gaussian) distribution. This has the following characteristics:

- midpoint is set by mean parameter mu
- width of curve is set by another parameter σ, std. dev. parameter.
- some statisticians use σ^2 instead of σ.
